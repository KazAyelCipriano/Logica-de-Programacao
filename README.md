# Sorting Algorithms Compilation

This repository contains a compilation of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python. The sorting algorithms included are:

- **QuickSort**
- **SelectionSort**
- **TimSort**
- **BubbleSort**
- **MergeSort**

Each algorithm is implemented and demonstrated with sample data. The repository serves as a resource for understanding the basic working principles of these commonly used sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Overview

### 1. QuickSort
QuickSort is a highly efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

### 2. SelectionSort
SelectionSort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

### 3. TimSort
TimSort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It is the default sorting algorithm used in Pythonâ€™s `sorted()` function. It performs well on many kinds of real-world data.

### 4. BubbleSort
BubbleSort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the list is sorted.

### 5. MergeSort
MergeSort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.
